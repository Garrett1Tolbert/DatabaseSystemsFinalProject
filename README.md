# DatabaseSystemsFinalProject
Final Project for Database Systems in Google Tech Exchange Program using MongoDB

The scope of this project is that I realized there are some students in this program who still don't know each other. The purpose of this application is to allow students to grow their network. I collected data from the students, classes, and mentors in this program. You are able to query from the database and do things like Insert, Find, Update, Delete, or Aggregate.
